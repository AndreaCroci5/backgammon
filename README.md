# backgammon

## The Game


### About
The purpose of this project is to build a PC version of the famous backgammon board game.  
The game will be written in Java language and will support two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs AI.  
This project purpose is to serve as a personal challenge to put into practice two aspects learnt in different courses during my experience at Politecnico di Milano. In particular, the structure of the game will cover the topics of the course "Ingegneria del Software", while the AI aspect of this project will
be a trial to test the skills acquired in the course "Foundations of Artificial Intelligence".

### Project Structure
This project will follow the standard MVC pattern:  
- MODEL: contains the board data of both players and evolves as the Controller makes the changes
- CONTROLLER: is the agent that operates on the model by receiving inputs from the View
- VIEW: takes the input from the user and passes them to the Controller, while it shows on screen the Model changes

### Language
JAVA

### Software used
